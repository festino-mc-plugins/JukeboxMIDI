# JukeboxMIDI
Minecraft plugin that allows you to record a sequence of notes on a record.

There are currently 2 ways to record notes in a book:
* Write notes by hand  
(e.g. using [utility](https://github.com/festino-mc-plugins/NbsNoteConverter) that creates notes from .nbs files)
* Record sounds from note blocks  
(press RMB while crouching)  
There will be a third one in the future: directly upload the .nbs file with appropriate BPM.

Using a book and 6 coals, you can craft a music disc - the result slot will report if there are errors in the syntax.
